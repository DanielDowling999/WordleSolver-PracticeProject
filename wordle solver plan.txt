Three boxes: 

One that lets the user type in letters that should be in the word

One that lets the user type in letters that aren't in the word. 

One that lets the user type in where the good letters should be?

Don't allow spoiled text to be entered (only alphabetical characters).
Must have at least one correct character.

When allowed, search words.txt for words that match the proposed letters.

Steps: 
1. Take in User Input
2. Parse User Input ('Find words containing good letters, without containing bad letters')
3. Print result.


ToDo: 
- User Input and GUI
- Implement the ability for the user to input where a specific letter should be (green). 

Extra: Implement the ability for the user to input where a specific letter isn't (yellow).
